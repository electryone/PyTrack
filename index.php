					<h3>Python Powered</h3>
					<img src="./img/ampersand.png" class="thumb" alt="Placeholder">
					<p>PyTrack is built on Python and PyGame, rather than complex libraries, making  
						it really easy to use, modify, and extend without being an expert programmer. </p>

					<h3>Free and Open Source</h3>
					<img src="./img/light.png" class="thumb" alt="Placeholder">
					<p>No reason to pay for expensive commercial software, PyTrack is free for your use and tinkering.
